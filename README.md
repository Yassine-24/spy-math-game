# 🕵️ Spy Math Game — Agent Training Program

Welcome to the **Spy Math Mission**, a top-secret math game built for 3rd–4th grade operatives in training. This game tests your ability to identify number patterns, remember key codes, and solve logic-based puzzles — all under the pressure of a countdown timer.

## 🎯 About the Game

**Spy Math Game** is an interactive, browser-based educational game designed to:
- Strengthen number pattern recognition (divisibility by 2, 3, 4, 5)
- Enhance memory through secret code tracking
- Promote logic and decision-making
- Offer an engaging alternative to traditional math drills

The interface is themed like a secret agent operation, with each round referred to as a “Mission.” Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to crack the final secret code before time runs out.

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. **Start the Mission**  
   When you open the game, a 15-minute timer begins counting down. Don't waste a second!

2. **Follow Each Prompt**  
   At the top of the screen, you'll receive a mission prompt like:
   - “Select numbers divisible by 2”

   Below the prompt, you’ll see a 4×5 grid of 20 buttons — each with a number from 1–300.

3. **Select the Correct Numbers**  
   Click on the numbers that match the mission prompt (e.g., numbers divisible by 2).  
   - ✅ If your choice is correct, the button will turn green.
   - ❌ If you click incorrectly, it will flash red temporarily.

4. **Find the Golden Numbers**  
   Two correct numbers throughout the game will glow **gold** instead of green.  
   These are **your secret code numbers** — **REMEMBER THEM**.  
   You’ll need them at the very end to win.

5. **Advance to the Next Mission**  
   After selecting all correct numbers in a round, click **“Next Mission →”** to move forward.  
   You’ll play a total of 4 rounds.

6. **Crack the Final Code**  
   When you reach the final mission, you’ll be asked to enter the code.  
   This is the **two golden numbers combined** — either order is accepted.  
   - Example: If the golden numbers were 168 and 60, enter `16860` or `60168`.

7. **Win or Be Compromised**  
   - ✅ Enter the correct code to see your victory screen and replay option.
   - ⏰ If the timer runs out before you finish, your mission is a failure.
